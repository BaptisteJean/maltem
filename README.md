Movie Library Assignment is a movie management application. The goal of this project is to evaluate my technical skills as java full stack developper and other technologies such as Angular Version 6, Spring framework version 2.5.1, Bootstrapp version 4, Java 8, Json, Git (the basics), etc.

In this application we will be able to use some crud methods such as:
 - the creation of a movie,
 - the removal of a movie,
 - updating a movie
 - list all the movies
 - filter movies according to a research element
